A curated collection of competitive programming solutions, practice problems, and short notes. This repository showcases problem-solving skills across platforms like AtCoder, Codeforces, CodeChef, LeetCode, CSES and VJudge — organized by contest and topic for quick browsing.

---

**About**
- Purpose: present a clean, professional portfolio of algorithmic problem solving and contest participation.
- Audience: recruiters, teammates, and collaborators who want to evaluate practical algorithm and coding skills.

**One-line:** Competent competitive programmer focusing on clean C++ solutions, algorithm design, and fast iteration.

**What you'll find in this repo**

- Organized folders for each contest/platform (`AtCoder/`, `CodeChef/`, `Codeforces/`, `LeetCode/`, `CSES/`, `Vjudge/`, `EOlymp/`).
- Clear, commented C++ solutions with concise filenames showing problem IDs and short titles.
- Short problem notes and approach comments where helpful.

---

**Skills & Tools**

- Languages: C++ (primary), C, basic Bash / PowerShell for automation
- Algorithms: graph algorithms, greedy, DP, number theory, data structures (sets, maps, heaps), two-pointers, binary search, sorting & searching
- Tools: Git, VS Code, online judges (AtCoder, Codeforces, CodeChef, LeetCode)

---

**How to browse this portfolio**

- Browse by platform folder (e.g. `AtCoder/`, `Codeforces/`).
- Open files that match the contest or topic you want to review.
- Example: to open a local copy of `AtCoder/` solutions in VS Code, run:

	```powershell
	code AtCoder
	```

---

**Selected Highlights**

- Range of difficulty: beginner to advanced contest problems.
- Focus on readable, well-structured C++ solutions that pass time/memory limits on judge systems.
- Consistent naming and organization to make navigation and review easy for interviewers.

---

**How I approach problems**

1. Read & identify constraints and edge cases.
2. Choose the right algorithm/data structure and estimate complexity.
3. Implement a clear solution with boundary checks and minimal but useful comments.
4. Test locally with sample inputs before submission.
